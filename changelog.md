# Change Log Notes

---

## 23SEPT19

- Moved eslint, eslint-config-airbnb-base and eslint-plugin-import from dependencies to devDependencies

* Added a Change log to track what I am doing. Commit notes are very sparse sometimes
* Removed WebpackMonitor as it has not been maintained in 2 years
* Installed webpack-bundle-analyzer plugin
* Tried replacing the [selectSymbol, selectAffiliation, selectUnitSize, selectMod1, selectMod2] forEach loop with something better but got bogged down
