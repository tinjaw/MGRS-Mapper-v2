 /* ABOUT */
  In January of 2019 I began working on this app in my spare time. By June of that year it became an obsession. I sold my online business that month and quit my job in order to work on this full time. I know that this will never make me any money or bring me popularity but it became a project that I took a lot of pride in. I have lost track of all the late nights at 4am where my body is aching and I am falling out of my chair and I can't figure out what is causing a bug in my software -- oh wait, Jim you dumbass its because you used "new" as a variable name. You idiot, you absolute moron. Go to bed it's 4am (this actually happened). Does anyone ever read these? Shoot me an email if you do.
